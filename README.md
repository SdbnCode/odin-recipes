1) I know how to create a template for an html file
2) I know how to set the header 
3) I know how to add to the body
4) I know how to create links
5) I know how to insert images from my local pc
6) I know how to create order and unordered lists
7) I know how to upload my finished project to github
8) I know how to view that project from github
